## Logseq Plugin Samples

This repository contains sample code illustrating the Logseq Plugin API. You can read, play with or adapt from these
samples to create your own plugins.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm(or yarn)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed
on your system to run the examples. Then install the latest Logseq Desktop App
from [here](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases).

#### Using `nvm` to install `node` and `npm`

For those who are not familiar with the installation of Node.js and NPM, a simple solution would be to install **Node Version Manager (NVM)**[(link)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). The installation is straighforward: just download and run the [installation bash script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.38.0/install.sh). You may need to give access permissions to the script.

After installing `nvm`, using the command `nvm install 16`(for current) or `nvm install 14`(for LTS), youll be able to unstall install the current version of node and npm on your machine. Because `nvm` installs locally, there is not need for the `sudo` command. 
 
For those familiar, `nvm` acts similarly to `anaconda`: the same way you can select your version of python with anaconda, you can choose your version of node.js. 


### Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/logseq/logseq-plugin-samples`
- open Logseq Desktop client and turn on `Developer mode` in user settings panel
- open the toolbar dot menus and navigate to plugins page
- read the README file of the sample you want to load, then determine if it should be
  rebuilt (`npm install && npm run build`)
- click `Load unpacked package` button, then select the sample directory to load it
